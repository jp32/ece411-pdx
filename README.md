# Automated Plant Watering Device

This project enables the watering of indoor house plants without being physically present. As various plants need different watering levels, a knob (actually a potentiometer) is set by the user to determine the amount of time to water the plant, which can be set between 5 to 30 seconds. A mositure sensor is used to monitor the soil, in which water is automatically dispensed when the soil is near dry.

## Prerequisites

Boards are pre-installed with the lastest firmware. To upload the test bench firmware the latest version of the Arduino IDE is recommended (free and can be downloaded [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)).
